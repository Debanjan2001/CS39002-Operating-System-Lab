## Description

This repository contains all the implementations of the systems programming concepts learnt in the Operating Systems course.

The directories present in this repository are as follows:

- `a1-shell-scripting` : Implementatation and familiarization with shell scripting and popular/frequently used shell commands.

- `a2-custom-shell` : Implementation of a command-line interpreter like Linux shell in C++ with support for foreground/background command execution, I/O redirection, process termination, multi-process status monitoring,command auto-completion searchable history etc using POSIX system calls like fork, exec, signal, pipe etc.

- `a3-parallel-matrix-multiplication` : Implementation of parallel matrix multiplication as a deadlock-free producer consumer problem using shared memory and semaphores.

- `a4-threads-and-locks` : Implementation of a producer consumer problem in the form of a job dependency tree with the use of threads,locks and shared memory.

- `a5-memory-management-unit` : Implementation of a basic memory management library in C++ to ensure efficient usage of resources with functionalities like word alignment, 4 custom data types, garbage collection using threads and mutex locks to prevent data corruption.
