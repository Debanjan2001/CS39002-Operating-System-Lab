Q1:
    >> Run:
        $ bash Assgn1_1a_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh [number]
        (where [number] is the number that is to be factorized.)
    
    >> Output: the console itself

Q2:
    >> Run:
        $ bash Assgn1_1b_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh
        (assuming '1.b.files' folder is present in the current directory of the shell terminal.)
    
    >> Output: '1.b.files.out' directory, '1.b.out.txt' file

Q3:
    >> Run:
        $ bash Assgn1_1c_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh
        (assuming 'data1c' folder is present in the current directory of the shell terminal.)
    
    >> Output: '1.c.out' directory  (all extension specific folders will form here.)

Q4:
    >> Run:
        $ bash Assgn1_1d_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh
        (assuming 'temp' folder(after unzipping data1d.zip) is present in the current directory of the shell terminal.)
    
    >> Output: 'files_mod' directory

Q5:
    >> Run:
        $ bash Assgn1_1e_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh
        (assuming '1.e.files' directory (containing json files inside it) is present in the current directory of the shell terminal.)

        $ bash Assgn1_1e_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh -v
        (run in verbose mode)
    
    >> Output: the ip, the response headers and the required headers are printed on the console itself.
               'example.html', 'valid.txt' and 'invalid.txt' are formed in the current directory of the shell terminal itself.

Q6:
    >> Run:
        $ bash Assgn1_1f_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh [input_filename] [input_column_number]
        (assuming input_file is present in the same directory as of this script)
    
    >> Output: '1f_output_[input_column_number]_column.freq' file is formed in the working directory

Q7:
    >> Run:
        $ bash Assgn1_1g_35_19CS30014_19CS10048.sh [output_csv_filename] [input_column_number] [input_regex]
    
    >> Output: the file with random numbers named as [output_csv_filename] given will be formed in the current directory of the shell terminal itself.
               the output of the search will be displayed in the console itself
